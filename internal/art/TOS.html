    <h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
    <p><i>Last updated 4/29/2024</i>
        By ordering a commission from this artist, you and the artist both agree to the following terms and conditions:
    </p>
    <h2>USAGE</h2>
    <h3>Permissions of Use</h3>
    <p>The final commission must be fully paid for prior to any use. Commissions can be used in any of the following
        with proper credit to me, the artist:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adopts and/or auctions for characters that you own</li>
        <li>Social Media Icons</li>
        <li>Videos, thumbnails, or livestreams</li>
        <li>Emojis or stickers</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My artwork, including commissions, is not to be used for any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unauthorized Advertisements or Commercial Use</li>
        <li>Your own personal commission examples </li>
        <li>Hatespeech or Harassment</li>
        <li>Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additional usage can be requested via contacting me, the artist, through social media or email.</p>

    <h3>AI & Crypto Policy</h3>
    <p>I do not allow my artwork to be used in AI training algorithms, datasets, AI tools, or replicated in any way
        using AI. The commissioner must disclose prior to requesting a commission if this art is to be used in promotion
        of AI in any way, shape, or form. <br>
        I do not allow my artwork to be used for block-chain related technology including, but not limited to, NFTs,
        cryptocurrency, or related products.
        I, the artist, hold the right to cancel commissions with no refund if this policy is to be broken or there are
        false claims about the commission’s usage that have been made during the commission process.

    <h3>Proper Crediting</h3>
    <p>I, the artist, can be credited using any of the following social medias:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>https://ko-fi.com/goosecaboose737</li>
        <li>https://a-sweeter-solarsystem.tumblr.com</li>
        <li>https://www.youtube.com/goosecaboose737 </li>
    </ul>

    <p>You do not have to provide a direct link to my social media on the condition that you state the platform
        associated with that username. A sample of proper credit using this method is as follows:
        “Commission by Goosecaboose737 on youtube” / “Commission by a-sweeter-solarsystem on tumblr”<br>
        A direct link can be used in place of the platform being listed. A sample of proper credit using this method is
        as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>“Commission by Goosecaboose737” / “Commission by a-sweeter-solarsystem”</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Posting only the watermarked version of the final commission does not count as proper credit. Text credit must
        be placed alongside the final commission. You must contact me and receive my written permission prior to any
        usage of the final commission without text credit.</p>

    <h2>Commission Process</h2>

    <h3>Standard Digital Illustrations & Pixel Art</h3>
    <h4>Artwork Provided</h4>
    <p>During the commission process I, the artist, will provide the client with an initial concept sketch, a minimum of
        one work in progress image, and a watermarked version of the final image. A non watermarked version of the final
        commission will only be provided after the final payment(s) has been received.</p>

    <h3>2D Animation</h3>
    <h4>Artwork Provided</h4>
    <p>No animation work will be started until an agreed upon down payment has been provided and successfully received.
        Upon receiving a successful down payment, the client will be provided with a rough animation sketch of the
        request within one to two weeks. This can include keyframes, light tweaning, messy linework, and non-finalized
        movements. Client approval must be provided and documented prior to further animation progress.<br>
        Additionally, the client will receive multiple work in progress images and files during the animation process.
        Client and artist communication is imperative as to ensure the client is satisfied with the work being provided.
        <br>
        All work in progress images will be watermarked accordingly. The final, non-watermarked, animation will be
        delivered after the final payment has been acquired.
    </p>

    <h2>Payment</h2>
    <p>All payment and pricing will use the United States dollar (USD). I, the artist, will accept other forms of
        non-crypto currency provided that they can be converted to USD. I do not accept crypto currency in exchange for
        artwork.</p>
    <h3>Standard Digital Illustrations & Pixel Art</h3>
    <p>I, the artist, will provide you with a price estimate of your requested commission based on the client’s request.
        Once a price has been agreed upon, a non-refundable down payment worth 10% of the final cost must be provided.
        This is to ensure that I, the artist, do not go unpaid for my work in the event that the commission cannot be
        completed. I will then follow my standard commission process as noted above. The remaining balance for the
        commission can be paid for in small quantities over time, or as one larger payment.</p>
    <h3>2D Animation</h3>
    <p>In order to request an animated commission, the client must fill out a quote form. The commission will not start
        unless both the artist and client have an agreed upon price based off of this initial quote. After this point, a
        non-refundable down payment worth 25% of the final cost must be provided up front prior to any work done on the
        animation. The animation process will begin after this down payment has been received. This is to ensure that,
        in the event the animation cannot be paid for, the client is still provided artwork and I, the artist, do not go
        unpaid for my work. <br>
        The remaining balance for the commission can be paid for in small quantities over time, or as one larger
        payment. I, the artist, will not provide you with any finished animation until the remaining balance has been
        paid for.</p>
    <h3>Payment Methods</h3>
    <p>Paypal and Venmo are the only accepted payment methods for art commissions. Due to additional fees that are
        applied while using this service, pricing may be adjusted over time including during the commission process. The
        client will always be notified of any price changes for their piece as needed, and the commission will not
        progress unless the price change is agreed upon.</p>

    <h2>Cancelation and Alterations During the Commission Process</h2>
    <h3>Cancellations & Refunds</h3>
    <p>I, the artist, hold the right to cancel a commission for any reason at any point. I will provide the client with
        a refund provided the client provided steady communication and partial payment of the final piece after the down
        payment has been acquired. I do not have to disclose my reason for canceling the commission to the client.
        Disrespectful behavior towards me, the artist, may result in a cancellation.<br>

        Cancellations on commissions will be permitted prior to sending the watermarked version of the final commission.
        If the client cancels after the watermarked version of the final piece has been sent, I will continue to ask for
        payment. If after 3 days the client refuses contact or payment, the watermarked image will be withdrawn and the
        client will be blacklisted. No refund will be provided after this point. <br>
        A grace period of two weeks of no contact will be assumed prior to any commission being automatically canceled.
        After this two week grace period is over, I, the artist, will not provide you with a refund after this
        point.<br>

        If the client cancels prior to the watermarked version of the final piece being sent, a refund can be requested
        equal to the balance received during the commission process. The down payment is non refundable.</p>

    <h2>Alterations</h2>
    <p>I, the artist, cannot alter the final piece after the watermarked version has been sent unless the alteration is
        a minor fix, such as changing the color of an item of clothing or adding small details to the character (small
        is defined as an alteration that would take 10 minutes or less to fix).<br>
        I consider each stage of the commission process (stage as defined as moving from a sketch, to lineart, to flat
        coloring) as a stopping point, and will not continue work until I, the artist, have received feedback from the
        client. This means that I will not continue with lineart until the sketch has been approved, or I will not add
        flat colors and shading until the client approves the lineart. This is to ensure that the client is satisfied
        with the work being provided, and to avoid the need to alter the character later on in the commission process.
    </p>

    <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>Currently, I will only provide refunds to clients for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Work has been started on the commission but I, the artist, am unable to continue to progress.</li>
        <li>The client cancels prior to the watermarked version of the final piece being sent.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following is non refundable:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Down payments for commissioned pieces (both animated and non-animated)</li>
        <li>Any amount paid after the non watermarked version of the final piece has been sent.</li>
        <li>Amounts added due to currency conversions. This is to be dealt with on the clients side as I, the artist,
            have no control over currency rates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Contact</h2>

    <p>I, the artist, can be contacted through any of the following methods:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Email: lukas.stop.business@gmail.com</li>
        <li>Direct message through ko-fi: https://ko-fi.com/goosecaboose737 </li>
    </ul>

    <p>I cannot be reached through any other method. If you are unable to contact me through email or ko-fi, I cannot
        provide you with a commission. Additional questions about my commission process can also be sent through my
        tumblr: https://a-sweeter-solarsystem.tumblr.com</p>
